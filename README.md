# Configuration Examples

All kinds of configurations I use for Nginx, Apache, Puppet, Ansible, or anything else that I like to put on Github, just as a reminder (how the frick did I do that again? ;)

## Nginx

I migrated my own webserver from Apache to Nginx, and had to get it working again with PHP-FPM (for Wordpress), NodeJS (for Ghost) and Ruby on Rails/Rack with SSL on a seperate port (for Puppet Master). 

## Ansible and Puppet

I've been playing around with Chef, Ansible and Puppet. You'll find recipes / playbooks / manifests I've come up with here too.
